=============

Special thanks to those creators on the list, without them this App were never to be born.

The libraries that used by OurDailyBread App were directly included(referenced) as a full project(start with the prefix "lib_"). In this way, we can make our own customization much easier.

You can check [Project Properties](#project-properties) section to see how the properties should be set up.


Cheers.
